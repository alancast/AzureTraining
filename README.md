Me learning how to use Azure

## Step 1 (Blob storage)

Write to and read back from blob storage. Goal of this is basically to learn how to use blob storage.

## Step 2 (Event Hub)

Write a simple program that sends events to event hub and then write one that receives events from event hub. Once these are both completed you should have a very rudimentary abillity to send messages and immediately see them being received (Parrot Event Hub just gets sent strings and immediately repeats them).

## Step 3 (Functions)

Write a function that gets triggered by different things. The starter HTTPTrigger function is just the generic get triggered by an HTTP call. The other one is trigger an event from an event hub event. This is more interesting (and harder to set up and debug and stuff)
